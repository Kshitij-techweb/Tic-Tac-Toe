# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3Ã—3 grid. It tracks the current player, detects wins and draws, and lets users restart the game. This project helped me practice core web development skills like DOM manipulation and basic game logic.
